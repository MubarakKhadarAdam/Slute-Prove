      <p class="info">Xbox Series X is the next-generation Xbox. Previously known by its codename 'Xbox Project Scarlett', the Xbox Series X was officially revealed at The Game Awards 2019 with a trailer that showed off the next Xbox in all its glory.So far we know when the next Xbox will release, its official name and a couple of the console's launch titles, as well as information on backwards compatibility and how cross-gen game ownership will work under the new 'Smart Delivery' initiative. We also know it will have a slightly redesigned controller that should be more accessible, and offer 1TB SSD upgrades from Seagate.From what we've seen so far, it looks like the Xbox Series X will sport a blockier style that's similar to that of a small gaming PC. More importantly, we now know what's inside the console thanks to Microsoft giving us the Series X's full specs and can say for sure that the new Xbox is going to be an absolute powerhouse.But Xbox Series X will not be the only next-generation hardware on offer from Microsoft. The company has confirmed that the next-generation family of consoles will be called 'Xbox' and that 'Series X' is just one of the consoles within that family that's likely to include a cheaper disc-drive free version as well.</p>
