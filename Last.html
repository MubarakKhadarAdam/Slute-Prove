    <h1 class="info">The Last of Us 2 had PS4 owners counting down the days to its May 29 release date, about the game has been delayed due to coronavirus, with no new date announced. It's a blow to the fans, who are now facing this third delay with no end in sight, and no doubt a blow for the developers at Naughty Dog too.</h1>
    
    <h1 class="info">The game is a direct sequel to 2013's The Last of Us, and will focus on Ellie, now older, tougher, and just as capable as taking out a clicker with brutal force as her former protector Joel. We've been lucky enough to go hands-on with a large section of the game, getting a taste of the violence Ellie is able to inflict, and the consequences of it, and we've spoken to Naughty Dog writer Halley Gross about the story behind it all.</h1>
    
    <h1 class="info">Naughty Dog is suspiciously good at keeping story secrets hidden until the game is in the hands of players, so don't be surprised if there are still some tricks up its sleeves when it comes to Ellie's new life. We don't know when the new release date will be, here's everything we know about The Last of Us 2. </h1>

    <h1 class="info">If you want to buy this game should play the first part of the game, so you can understand the second part. This game is continues of the last game. The creaters of the game are best when it comes to creating a good storie line. </h1>
